# Advent of Code solutions in F*

My goal is to try to prove each solution correct, using appropriate types.

To run the solutions, you will need to replace the include in each Makefile
with your own installed Makefile.include from the F* distribution.

## F* language resources

F* is an OCaml-like language for "proof-oriented programming".  It supports:
  * dependent types and proofs
  * a metaprogramming system
  * reasoning about effectful programs

### Forums, etc.

There's a Slack instance but it requires a google.com or microsoft.com email
address to sign up.

The "fstar-club" mailing list site hasn't responded when I've tried to visit it.

I've joined the Zulip forum for F*, but it appears to be low-traffic: https://fstar.zulipchat.com/

## Notes on installing F* on Ubuntu

The precompiled Linux binaries need a newish version of glibc.
Ubuntu LTS 18.04 didn't work, I upgraded to Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (glibc 2.31)
and that seemed OK.  Then I started puzzling out the dependencies for
the "hello world" example.

I found that batteries doesn't work with 4.13.  Try version 4.12.
(Unfortunately there wasn't a clear error message that this was the problem;
opam does a complicated process to match dependencies, and does not seem
to have an error for "your compiler is newer than this package supports."

In the [INSTALL guide for F*](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md#instructions-for-linux-and-mac-os-x), it says:

> Note: To compile OCaml code generated by F*, using a F* binary package is not the preferred method. You should install F* via OPAM instead.

This was not mentioned in https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Executing-F%2A-code, alas.  So this is what I ended up doing; [install `opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html), use it to install OCaml 4.12, and then installed F*
