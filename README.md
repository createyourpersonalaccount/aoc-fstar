# Advent of Code solutions in F*

An attempt is made to prove each solution correct, using an appropriate type.


## Notes on installing F* on Ubuntu

The precompiled Linux binaries need a newish version of glibc.
Ubuntu LTS 18.04 didn't work, I upgraded to Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (glibc 2.31)
and that seemed OK.  Then I started puzzling out the dependencies for
the "hello world" example.

```
apt install ocaml 
apt install ocamlbuild 
apt install ocaml-findlib
apt install ocaml-batteries-included
apt install libzarith-ocaml
```

... oops, no ppx, that's only in 21.10, better try opam

```
apt install opam
opam init
opam switch create 4.13
```

Oops, batteries doesn't work with 4.13.  Try version 4.12.

```
opam install ppx_deriving
opam install ppx_deriving_yojson
opam install batteries
opam install ocamlbuild
opam install ocamlfind
opam install stdint
opam install pprint
opam install zarith
```

That works, but example

```
make -C examples/hello hello
```

does not work because examples/Makefile.include

```
ifdef FSTAR_HOME
   FSTAR_ULIB=$(FSTAR_HOME)/ulib
else
   # FSTAR_HOME not defined, assume fstar.exe installed through opam
   # or binary package, and reachable from PATH
   FSTAR_ULIB=$(dir $(shell which fstar.exe))/../lib/fstar
endif
```

which doesn't match the binary distribution, so... set FSTAR_HOME?

Should have read further in INSTALL, which says:

> Note: To compile OCaml code generated by F*, using a F* binary package is not the preferred method. You should install F* via OPAM instead.

Not mentioned in https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Executing-F%2A-code, alas.
